# HEIC to JPG Converter Script

If you have a bunch of HEIC image files that you need to convert to JPG, you can use this Python script that automates the process for you. The script utilizes [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), a popular image manipulation software that you'll need to install before running the script.

To use the script, copy it to the folder that contains the HEIC files you want to convert. When you run the script, it will automatically convert all the HEIC files in that folder to JPG files, and move the original HEIC files to a separate folder.
